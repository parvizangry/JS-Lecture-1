# JavaScript is a popular programming language that has a wide range of applications.
## JavaScript was previously used mainly for making webpages interactive such as form validation, animation, etc. Nowadays, JavaScript is also used in many other areas such as server-side development, mobile app development and so on.

## Java Script is also used in many other areas
### JavaScript is a programming language that can be used for various purposes, such as creating dynamic web pages, developing web applications, building games, and more. 

* Creating dynamic and interactive web pages, such as zooming in and out, playing audio or video, validating forms, etc. For example, websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Wikipedia use JavaScript to enhance the user experience and functionality of their web pages
  
* Developing web and mobile applications, using frameworks and libraries such as React, Angular, Ionic, and React Native. For example, applications like Netflix, Uber, Instagram, and Airbnb use JavaScript to create user interfaces, manage data, and communicate with servers

* Building web servers and server-side applications, using platforms such as Node.js and Express. For example, applications like PayPal, LinkedIn, Medium, and eBay use JavaScript to handle requests, process transactions, and perform business logic .

* Creating games that operate inside the browser, using technologies such as HTML5, Canvas, and WebGL. For example, games like Tetris, Flappy Bird, Doodle Jump, and Space Invaders use JavaScript to render graphics, control animations, and implement game logic .

* Implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning projects, using libraries such as TensorFlow.js, Brain.js, and Synaptic. For example, projects like Teachable Machine, Face API, and Sentiment Analysis use JavaScript to train and run neural networks, detect faces and emotions, and analyze text .

## A BRIEF HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT
### In 1995 Brendan Eich created the very first version of Java Script in just 10 days. It was called Mocha, but already had been many fundamental features of modern JavaScript!

### In 1996 Mocha changed to LiveScript and then to JavaScript, in order to attract Java developers. However, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java 👆

### ECMA script is a standart for scripting language. JavaScript is a language that follows the ECMAScript standard. 
***Вы можете думать о ECMAScript как о проекте, а JavaScript — как о доме, построенном на основе этого проекта.***

### The biggest update to the language EVER was in ES6 in 2015.

## Because of its wide range of applications, you can run JavaScript in several ways:
 * Using console tab of web browsers
 * Using Node.js
 * By creating web pages
  

  1. Using Console Tab of Web Browsers
      * 1' Open your browser and right click in any empty area and select inspect or press F12.
      * 2' Open the developer tools and go to Console tab. Write the Javascript code and press Enter
  
  2. Using Node.js
     * In a server: You can use Node.js, which is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser, such as on a server or a desktop application. You can install Node.js from its official website2 and then use the command line to run JavaScript files or enter commands. For example, you can run a JavaScript file named app.js by typing `node app.js` in the terminal.

  3. By creating web pages
     * 1' Create new folder
     * 2' Create index.html, script.js files
     * 3' Write shown line of codes
     * You can use the script tag in an HTML file to include JavaScript code, for this you need to write the "src" attribute inside the script and select your .js file
  
  # JavaScript Variables and Constants
  ## In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.
  ### In Javascript there are two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them. However, there are some differences between them.  
  ### If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommended to use const .
